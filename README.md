Rules of Yahtzee:

Game length is 13 rounds. Each round consists of rolling 5 dice. 

Each roll of dice scores in one of 13 categories.

You get three total rolls, the first roll is all dice while the next two can be any of them. 

5 Dice, integers 1-5, using an ArrayList and Math.random * 5 to generate the numbers.

Scanner object

There is up to 6 different scores one can get with each throw, so there should be an option at the end of the third throw
to decide which points

ToDo List
[]Create Scanner object that prompts user to begin game
[]Make first roll method that generates an ArrayList filled with 5 random integers.

[]Make a second/third roll method that allows the first roll ArrayList to be changed.
